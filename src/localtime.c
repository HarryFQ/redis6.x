/* This is a safe version of localtime() which contains no locks and is
 * fork() friendly. Even the _r version of localtime() cannot be used safely
 * in Redis. Another thread may be calling localtime() while the main thread
 * forks(). Later when the child process calls localtime() again, for instance
 * in order to log something to the Redis log, it may deadlock: in the copy
 * of the address space of the forked process the lock will never be released.
 *（这是localtime()的安全版本，它不包含锁，而且是fork()友好。甚至localtime()的_r版本也不能安全使用在复述。另一个线程可能正在调用localtime()，而主线程
 * forks()。例如，当子进程再次调用localtime()时为了记录一些东西到Redis日志，它可能死锁:在副本分支进程的地址空间的锁将永远不会被释放。）
 *
 * This function takes the timezone 'tz' as argument, and the 'dst' flag is
 * used to check if daylight saving time is currently in effect. The caller
 * of this function should obtain such information calling tzset() ASAP in the
 * main() function to obtain the timezone offset from the 'timezone' global
 * variable. To obtain the daylight information, if it is currently active or not,
 * one trick is to call localtime() in main() ASAP as well, and get the
 * information from the tm_isdst field of the tm structure. However the daylight
 * time may switch in the future for long running processes, so this information
 * should be refreshed at safe times.
 *（该函数以时区“tz”为参数，而“dst”标志为用于检查夏时制当前是否生效。调用者的，需要通过调用tzset()尽快获取这些信息函数的作用是:从全局变量“时区”中获取时区偏移量
 * 变量。要获取日光信息，如果它当前是活动的，一个技巧是也尽快在main()中调用localtime()，并获取来自tm结构的tm_isdst字段的信息。然而,日光对于长时间运行的进程，
 * 时间可能会在将来切换，所以以下信息应该在安全的时间恢复。）
 *
 * Note that this function does not work for dates < 1/1/1970, it is solely
 * designed to work with what time(NULL) may return, and to support Redis
 * logging of the dates, it's not really a complete implementation.
 * （注意，这个函数对于日期< 1/1/1970不起作用，它是唯一的设计与什么时间(空)可能返回，并支持Redis记录日期，这不是一个真正完整的实现。）
